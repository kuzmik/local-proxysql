  # Wrapper method that calls all the necessary pausing functions and handles the sleeping.
  # Steps taken:
  #   1. sleep READINESS_STATE_DELAY seconds to allow some time for the Service to remove the pod from EndpointSlices
  #   2. disable new connections to proxysql, while allowing existing connections to drain
  #   3. sleep @options[:shutdown_delay] seconds (which should be equal to the containers's TerminationGracePeriod - READINESS_STATE_DELAY - PRE_KILL_BUFFER)
  #   4. exit
  def stop
    # [tag:prestop_draining] Touch the draining file, which [ref:probes_draining] probes.rb uses to determine that even
    # if checks would return unhealthy, they should pass.
    FileUtils.touch('/tmp/draining')

    puts "#{ENV.fetch('HOSTNAME', nil)} - ProxySQL pre-stop - Created /tmp/draining, sleeping for #{READINESS_STATE_DELAY} seconds"
    sleep READINESS_STATE_DELAY

    disable_new_connections

    puts "#{ENV.fetch('HOSTNAME', nil)} - ProxySQL pre-stop - Connections disabled, sleeping for #{@options[:shutdown_delay]} before exit"

    # sleep to prevent the script from exiting, which will kill the container immediately
    sleep @options[:shutdown_delay]
  end

  ##
  # This method will pause ProxySQL, which prevents new connections from being made. It will then start the process of
  # draining current connections, sleeping for {@options[:shutdown_delay]} seconds to allow any inflight transactions to
  # wrap up. If any txns are still in progress when the sleep expires, the container will be killed and they will be severed.
  #
  # MySQL variables modified by this method:
  # {connection_max_age_ms}[https://proxysql.com/documentation/global-variables/mysql-variables/#mysql-connection_max_age_ms]::
  #    When mysql-connection_max_age_ms is set to a value greater than 0, inactive connections in the connection pool
  #    (therefore not currently used by any session) are closed if they were created more than mysql-connection_max_age_ms
  #    milliseconds ago. By default, connections arenâ€™t closed based on their age. When mysql-connection_max_age_ms is
  #    reached, connections are simply disconnected, without sending COM_QUIT command to the server, so this might result
  #    in Aborted connection warnings showing up in your MySQL server logs (this behaviour is intended)
  #
  # {max_transaction_time}[https://proxysql.com/documentation/global-variables/mysql-variables/#mysql-max_transaction_time]::
  #    Sessions with active transactions running more than this timeout are killed.
  #
  # {wait_timeout}[https://proxysql.com/documentation/global-variables/mysql-variables/#mysql-wait_timeout]::
  #    If a proxy session (which is a conversation between a MySQL client and a ProxySQL) has been idle for more than
  #    this threshold, the proxy will kill the session.
